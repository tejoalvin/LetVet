Exercise 1.2In order for the code to be robust, the algorithm needs to check for the variable to be a date variable and the date format needs to be in the same format throughout all of the date data in the arrays. In this case the date format is month date, year.Exercise 1.3Time complexity of my algorithm for finding the minimal sorted time is O(n) as the algorithm needs to traverse over the arrays of date.
